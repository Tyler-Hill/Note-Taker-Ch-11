## Note Taker Challenge 11

## Description

This application is designed so that a user is easily able to access a page that they are able to create, delete, and edit notes on. A user will go to the deployed applications page, click the "get started" button, and then enter the main page of the application. They are greeted with one large text box, labeled "Note Title", and a smaller one labelled "Note Text". The user can then enter the title of their note and anything they need to remember, click the save button in the top right of the screen, and then have that note be saved to the left hand side of the screen. The user can then click that note to view it in its entirety, click the plus button in the top right to edit it, and then click the save button again to save the note to its changed contents.

## Usage

The user can utilize this application to easily create and save notes that they can access anywhere they have an internet connection for easy reference.
